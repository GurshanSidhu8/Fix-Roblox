"Subject: Request to Unblock the Roblox App on My Phone

Dear [Google Employee's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with unblocking the "Roblox" app on my phone.

Recently, I discovered that the Roblox app has been blocked on my device, and I am unable to access it. Roblox is an important platform for me, and I use it regularly for both entertainment and educational purposes.

Could you please help me understand why the app was blocked and what steps I need to take to unblock it? If there are any specific issues or policies I need to address, I am more than willing to comply to resolve this matter swiftly.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and guidance.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
